* bairstow
** what is it?
   this is Fortran program that factors given real polynomial into
   second degree polynomials using Bairstow's method (that is,
   guess the factor, divide by it, and hope that the result is zero
   polynomial. it isn't? apply newton method)
** what is it good for?
   it's good if you have a high degree polynomial, you want to find
   its zeros, and somehow you don't want to use any of the hundreds of
   available tools.
** does it work?
   kind of. you need to edit paths to lapack and blas in makefile,
   and i only compiled it with intel fortran. it does not have any
   useful interface, and i tested it only with a handful of
   polynomials.
** usage
   just run it, input is hardcoded (no, i'm not joking. no, i don't
   care).
** license
   do with it whatever you want, i'll be happy if you let me know that
   you find it interesting (maybe you do), or that you use it (wow,
   what for?)
