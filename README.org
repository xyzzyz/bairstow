** Description
   Fortran program that factors given real polynomial into second
   degree polynomials.
** Does it work?
   Kind of. Makefile requires one to edit paths to lapack and blas,
   and I only compiled it with Intel Fortran. It does not have any
   useful interface, and I tested it only with a handful of
   polynomials.
